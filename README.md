#### _An application that list the bikes that have been registered as stolen in a given location_

#### By _**Benson Limo**_

## Description

_This is an assignment for Moringa school to test your understanding of APIs_

#### Instructions for Haiku Checker/Creator

Build an app using the Bike Index APILinks to an external site.. Your app could list all the bikes that have been registered as stolen in a given location in the past week. Or it could display statistics — for instance, you could see which manufacturer is most frequently stolen in a given area.

To get started, check out the main page of the Bike Index API DocsLinks to an external site.. When you are ready to set up an API key, scroll down to find the "Your applications" section of "OAuth" — it's from here you can set up an account and get an API key.
